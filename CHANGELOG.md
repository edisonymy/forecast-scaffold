## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **`forecast` skill**: effort-tiered forecasting pipeline (`auto`/`low`/`medium`/`high` with an
  auto-triage rubric) with progressive-disclosure references: question hygiene, research
  protocol, the reasoning spine (reference-classes-first, structured debiasing), decomposition
  and fast proxies, aggregation rules, and multiple-choice/numeric/conditional handling.
- **`calibrate` skill**: the learning loop — resolve due forecasts, Brier score with direction of
  miscalibration, post-mortems tagged by pipeline step.
- **`forecast_scaffold` Python core** (zero dependencies, single file, vendored into each skill):
  ForecastRecord schema + append-only JSONL journal with idempotent resolve/annul; Brier +
  folded-confidence calibration report; trimmed-mean / geometric-mean-of-odds / median pooling
  with crowd blending and clamping; validators for probabilities, percentiles, and
  multiple-choice sets; percentile→CDF construction with platform-rule repair (ported from
  MIT-licensed forecasting-tools, attributed); CLI
  (`record | resolve | due | score | aggregate | validate | cdf | export | config`), including
  `export --format decision-record` interop.
- **Metaculus tournament bot** (`bot/`): stdlib API client, headless harness driving the same
  `forecast` skill with auto-effort triage and a validate-and-repair output contract, public
  committed journal; GitHub Actions workflows for dry runs and the 20-minute tournament cron.
- **Evals**: behavioral scenarios + pure graders (`scripts/behavioral_evals.py`,
  `evals/scenarios.json`) testing conduct (journal side effects), not wording.
- Plugin + marketplace manifests (installable via
  `/plugin marketplace add edisonymy/forecast-scaffold`), claude.ai skill bundles
  (`scripts/build_skill_bundles.sh` → `dist/*.zip`), CI (tests on Python 3.11/3.12, lint, strict
  types, vendored-copy sync check, personal-data leak guard, plugin validation), and docs
  (schema spec + DecisionRecord mapping, sourced design rationale, evaluation protocol).
